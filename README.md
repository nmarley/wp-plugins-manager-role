# WP Plugins Manager Role

WordPress plugin to add a role called 'Plugin Manager' which should only be
able to view/update plugins.

### License

WordPress is GPL (2?), that's good and well. But I don't like the GPL, so fuck it.
Adding an MIT license. I really don't care what anybody does with this plugin.
Just don't feel like hosting my own repo for every little thing I write these
days, so I'm hosting this on Github, and I feel like I should put a license if
something's on Github.

Licenses really are legally ambiguous bullshit anyway.
