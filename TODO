# TODOs

Apparently a new type is only registered once, even if the plugin is
deactivated and then re-activated. So, something will need to be done to
"undo", e.g. "turn off" plugin manager role once this plugin isn't working,
then re-activate it once it is... or a robust solution needs to be found.

But for a one-off script for allowing access to plugins/themes ONLY, this will
do nicely.

The intent of this was to enable a random person in India or eastern Europe to
be able to view my plugins and versions, then download the new versions and
upgrade them for me, to outsource that part of my work. Then I could just pay
someone $8-10/hour instead of it costing my $50-60/hour or more to do the same
work. (Since that's what I usually make for tech work.)


Use a **real** makefile, instead of this make.sh script, to generate a zipfile, as well as having a 'clean' option to remove it.
